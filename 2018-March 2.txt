setuptools is really an extension of distutils, and for this, the
distutils documentation provides what you need to know:

    https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files

Good luck!

Note that this will make it impossible to distribute wheels of your package
or to install it into a virtualenv, because those don't have an /etc. So
it's mostly only suitable for projects that you use internally under a
known and restricted set of deployment options, not for anything
distributed on pypi.

In the previous email I forgot to say I use setuptools not distutils.

(So it turns out I've taken on a volunteer gig, which is that I'm now
one of the Twine maintainers. I may be wrong about how to do this -
please feel free to comment on https://github.com/pypa/twine/pull/314
which is where I'm pulling together a new release checklist for myself.)

https://test.pypi.org/manage/project/twine/release/1.10.0rc1/

This is a release candidate for Twine 1.10.0 which I'm planning to
release early next week.

This release improves project registration usage text (in some cases
removing it where inapplicable), and updates `--repository[-url]` usage
text, prints progress to `stdout` instead of `stderr`, improves the
progressbar, and reorganizes and improves user and developer documentation.

Please see the changelog
https://twine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html for detailed notes
under "Next feature release".

I believe this is how you test it out:

  pip install --upgrade --pre --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/
--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple twine

Please check existing open issues at
https://github.com/pypa/twine/issues and open new ones if you have

I tried but as you can see in this job<https://travis-ci.org/yougov/paradocx/jobs/348705862>, the environment variables aren?t honored, so it seems I cannot test a twine release in Travis. At this point, I think I?ll just wait for the official release.

Thanks for working on this!

In my particular use-case, I rarely run twine myself, but instead rely on the Travis-CI DPL routine<https://github.com/travis-ci/dpl/blob/master/lib/dpl/provider/pypi.rb>. Looking at that code, I don?t see any means I have to test a pre-release version.

Given the presumably broad impact this one use-case has, it would be nice if there were a way to test it against pre-release versions of twine (and maybe also wheel, pip, and setuptools). Perhaps it would be worthwhile to propose a hook to that project to enable the versions of those projects to be specified for selective testing.

Oh, I just had an idea - perhaps one could set the PIP_PRE environment variable and that would affect the install and allow the pre-release to be tested. I?ll give that a go.

Maybe you could try writing a pip configuration file in $HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf (or /etc/pip.conf). Travis dpl must be using pip to download twine, and pip should be able to look there for a `pre` option.
(I just guess, haven?t tried myself)

My current guess is that if the RC were on https://pypi.org, rather than
https://test.pypi.org, Travis would be able to grab it using PIP_PRE.

Subject: PyPI & Warehouse update: redirecting & shutting down legacy by end of April
Date: Wed, 07 Mar 2018 14:48:34 -0500

The big PyPI news is that we're probably getting to the beta, which we'll publicize heavily, in the next 2 weeks, and redirecting traffic to the new PyPI and shutting down legacy PyPI by the end of April.[0] (Which is good, because that's about when our funding from Mozilla's Open Source Support[1][2] grant will probably run out.) We're working on making a list of third-party services to alert; please help us out.[3]

The PyCon North America talk schedule is out -- including Dustin Ingram's "Inside the Cheeseshop: How Python Packaging Works".[4] And we hope you'll join us to hack on packaging and distribution at the sprints, May 14-17.[5] And Nicole Harris is also tentatively planning to lead a Warehouse sprint at EuroPython in July.[6]

We've kept on working on features, bugfixes, testing, and infrastructure; here's a selection of the last week's work. Ernest has been continuing cabotage work to manage Kubernetes credentials,[7] and our new infrastructure is stood up & heavily tested. Nicole's doing user tests and taking lessons from that and turning them into issues -- feel free to ping her if you're open to talking with her for 30-60 minutes so she can see how you use the new PyPI.[8] Dustin fixed the issue "Version lookup should take PEP 440 normalization into account" #445 with multiple fixes involving a canonical version for each release.[9] And he also updated the official Python packaging guide to cover how you indicate multiple emails in core metadata.[10] And, thanks to Ernest, PyPI legacy now has a banner for logged-in users, asking them to test pypi.org.[11]

Thanks to volunteers:
   * yeraydiazdiaz for password strength gauge[12]
   * jw for changing "Edit" to "Manage" in project management screen[13]
   * aalmazan for updating a checkbox to use the Stimulus framework[14]

We also brought up the possibility of changing the PyPI URL structure, in case you want to weigh in.[15]

Last week's office hours/IRC livechat went okay! Not as many participants as I would like, but this particular publicity/feedback structure is fairly new to the Python packagers community and I didn't do enough advance publicity. We got praise for the new PyPI, and we got bug reports and related comments and concerns (for Warehouse and related tools), and we shared tutorials and tools and command-line tips that some experienced packagers didn't know about. And we got people to subscribe to the announce mailing list.[16]

Notes from the weekly Warehouse core developers' meeting are, as usual, on the wiki.[17] And you can keep up with our current and upcoming milestone progress at the GitHub rollout board overview.[18]

And, thanks to Mark Mangoba, PEP 541 is going to get further progress within the Packaging WG this week.[19]

We would love your help. Please test PyPI and let us know what works and doesn't work for you. Please let us know of third-party services that should get a heads-up about the changeover.[20] And please consider joining us and hacking on Warehouse.[21] We have 16 open good first issues.[22]

Thanks to Mozilla for their support for the PyPI & Warehouse work, and thanks to the PSF for facilitating it!

Hardcoding ~/.pypirc as the only possible location for repo configs makes
certain use cases, like deploying to a custom repo from Jenkins, difficult.
It should be possible to set a custom pypirc location, either through an

Hi,

I created a wheel for Linux / ppc64le (built on CentOS 7). When I try
to upload to PyPI via twine, the error message results:

  unsupported platform tag 'linux_ppc64le'


What is the status of the ppc64le wheel support? Is pip / PyPI support
expected soon?


Thanks,
Matt

PyPI supports Linux wheels in the form of "manylinux" builds. I don't
think there's any plan to support platform or distribution specific
Linux wheels beyond that. Having said that, I'm sure the Lunux
specialists will be able to give more detail (maybe one of the
manylinux versions handles ppc64le?)

The manylinux1 platform only supports x86-64 and x86-32 (i686) 
architectures. A quote from PEP 513:

Because CentOS 5 is only available for x86_64 and i686 architectures, 
these are the only architectures currently supported by the manylinux1 
policy.

If support is to be extended to other architectures, it requires a new 
standard (which has recently been discussed on this ML).

There was discussion nearly a year ago about adding a manylinux3
variant, based on CentOS 7, with ppc64le support:https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-March/030315.html

More recently, there was discussion of a manylinux variant based on
CentOS 6 to provide a newer base without expanding the supported
architectures:https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2018-January/031943.html
The latter discussion largely got stuck on whether we should switch from
numbered variants (manylinux2) to using dates in the name
(manylinux2014). If we can reach an agreement on that point, I think we
can probably move towards defining more manylinux variants.

https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingSprints is where I've started a
list of our upcoming planned sprints (right now, PyCon North America and
EuroPython), with who's attending each and what we might work on there.

At PyCon in Cleveland, possible work includes:

* User testing
* Updating the PyPA roadmap
* Packaging Problems triage
* PyPI API keys and two-factor auth, with Luke Sneeringer & Donald Stufft
* Architecture for new Warehouse API URL structure

Subject: [Distutils] new stuff overview, beta next week, user tests,
 & other Warehouse updates
Message-ID: <1521009545.3615304.1302437912.4FB5107F@webmail.messagingengine.com>

The new PyPI is still working towards our big public beta[1]. We have 7
open issues till we'll declare beta and make an outreach push (probably
late this week or early next week), and then 19 more open issues till we
can redirect/launch PyPI[2] probably in April (overview[3]). I've
started preparing a draft overview of what's new in
PyPI/packaging/distribution[4] to publicize along with the beta; it says
"not to be publicized" but I'll let you in on the secret early. Maybe
something in it is new to you as well!

As usual, we had a Warehouse core developers' meeting on Monday[5]. The
last week has seen a lot of polish and bugfixing and documentation for
Warehouse. For instance, project deletion is cleaner[6], we more
consistently indicate dangerous actions on a page[7], and there's now a
migration guide for third-party services[8] which we told several
projects about[9]. We've done some infrastructural work, like Datadog
instrumentation[10],  "Conveyor" (a shim for URL redirects)[11],  and
Cabotage improvements[12]. Here's an animated GIF demo of release phase
commands (scale up, scale down).[13] And we improved other codebases as
well, to fix Travis docs[14], get our HTTPS proxy service to deal with
big embedded images[15], and deal better with parsing invalid URLs in
READMEs[16].
Thanks to volunteers who got pull requests merged this week:
 * waseem[17]: we now send an email to primary email whenever primary
   email is changed
 * mds325[18]: clear input when the user closes the modal * dirn[19]: create a shortlink and redirect all requests for
   /p/<project>/ to /project/<project>/ * cryvate[20]: clarify project counter for searches with tons of
   results * Mariatta[21]: fix an email-sending issue 

And thanks to our many bug reporters, such as Andrew Nesbitt who noticed
an RSS feed discrepancy[22].

Check out the current discussion[23] of API keys, a bearer token
authentication scheme, and Macaroons in future PyPI.

Want to help?
 * Talk with Nicole about being a subject or interviewer for user
   tests![24]  She's been focusing on user tests and it's paid off, with
   a lot of bugs found and designs validated. * Got a good workaround for our CAPTCHA being blocked in  China[25]?
 * Consider joining us at sprints[26] in the next few months.
 * We have 24 good first issues open[27], and a "getting started"[28]
   guide, and quick turnaround on code review.
*Thanks to Mozilla Open Source Support[29] for their funding[30] for the
PyPI & Warehouse work.*

P.S. Usually I compose these weekly report emails in plain text; here
     I'm doing it in HTML with a plaintext fallback. Let me know if it's
     better, awful, etc. Also nearly no one *replies* to these emails so
     I'd also welcome your "hey this is useful to me!" offlist reply.

- Missing parentheses at the end of the GPG/PGP line

- I'd put the signup link for the new announce list right at the top,
like "this post has lots of important stuff, and if you don't want to
miss future important stuff, sign up here."

Mark was OK with changing PEP 571 over to manylinux2010, but there are also
some fixes needed for the current Platform Detection section, which isn't
spelling out the version of glibc used as the baseline marker:
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2018-February/031971.html

Cheers,
Nick.

P.S. If folks would like to nudge that process along a bit, I suspect Mark
may find it easier to find time to review a PR making those changes than he
would to draft the changes himself. I don't actually know that for sure
though - I'm just generalising from an approach that often works on me :)

Thanks. Fixed.

Ernest W. Durbin III also pointed out in IRC
http://kafka.dcpython.org/day/pypa-dev/2018-03-14 that the call to
action, at least in some predecessors of this announcement, was unclear;
I've revised
https://wiki.python.org/psf/PackagingWG/PyPIBetaAnnouncement#Migrating
accordingly.

Subject: [Distutils] Pip 10 is nearing release
Message-ID: <CACac1F8PJJmcvfn-djMS5G4B_4f5mPZDhgOu0ZWgv1o+KKodsg@mail.gmail.com>

After much work, we're pleased to announce that pip 10 is finally
nearing release. We're planning on releasing a beta version over the
weekend of 31 Mar/1 Apr, with the final release to follow about a
fortnight after (assuming no major issues are found).

Hopefully, as many people as possible will be able to test the new
version of pip during the beta period (or before - it's possible to
install pip from github if you don't want to wait!) so that we can
ensure that pip 10 is as robust as we can manage when it gets
released.

There are a number of new features in pip 10, as well as many months
of bug fixes and minor improvements. Highlights include:

1. Support for PEP 518 (declaring build dependencies in `pyproject.toml`)
2. Fixes for Unicode handling in build tools (notably on Windows)
3. The previously announced reorganisation of pip's internals
4. A new `pip config` command
5. Default upgrade strategy becomes "only-if-needed"

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this version of pip - it's
been a long time coming, and we apologise for the delay. The plan is
to ensure that future releases aren't delayed as long as this one was!

Paul, am I right in thinking that this:

   https://github.com/pypa/pip

is the place to look if we want an advanced preview?

That's correct.

If you want to upgrade (in a virtualenv, of course ;-)) then you can do

    python -m pip install -U git+https://github.com/pypa/pip

to get the latest copy from master. (Once the beta is released "python
-m pip install -U --pre pip" will install the beta).

Per

a pre-release of Twine. I released Twine 1.11.0rc1 a few days ago. Today

I wonder if you can help.... I am trying to install btcrecover which is no simple task. When I try and install pyopencl it keeps saying that it does not recognise it as a file name...

Do you have any ideas?

For problems installing particular projects, I'd also suggest investigating
the assistance options for *that project*. In many cases, installation
challenges are project specific, and it sounds like that may be the case
here.

I've made a PR to change the naming to manylinux2010, and add a
paragraph about the change:https://github.com/python/peps/pull/596

If we're happy with that, I can also look at changing the glibc version
thing, but that will probably involve a bit more actual thought. ;-)

It's really easy to send a PR to update CPython to the manylinux repo:

https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/pull/138

They are very friendly and receptive, by the way!

Hey all!

Given the direction we're moving with PEP 517/518, I propose that we rename
this list to something like python-packaging or something similar, to make
it a more relavantly named place for having discussions related to Python
Packaging in general.

I'm curious what others think about this. I'm definitely open to thoughts
and other ideas. :)

Cheers,
Pradyun

Maybe packaging-sig, to fit in with the other SIGs? See

I don?t think we can rename a mailing list easily, we can create a new one and archive the old one but that has a lot of churn and breaks people?s filters, etc.

There is a technical limitation that we would not be renaming the list as much as closing this one, and opening a new one.  That creates any number of social problems, for little to no benefit ? the name is slightly more relevant at the cost of breaking everyone?s subscriptions, and the mail filters of anyone who filters.  There are any number of glitches and headaches for what end?

 

It sounds nice but, it causes more real pain than the theoretical pain the current name causes.

Hey all!

 

Given the direction we're moving with PEP 517/518, I propose that we rename this list to something like python-packaging or something similar, to make it a more relavantly named place for having discussions related to Python Packaging in general.

 

I'm curious what others think about this. I'm definitely open to thoughts and other ideas. :)

Good point. I agree that not disrupting list users is more important
than the list name.

Yeah, this is the main reason we haven't changed the name already. I
wondered if Mailman 3 might offer native support for list renames, but
https://gitlab.com/mailman/mailman/issues/156 suggests that while the devs
are open to the idea, it isn't supported yet.

Cheers,
Nick.

Subject: [Distutils] PyPI/Warehouse: infrastructure hardening & the CAPTCHA
 conundrum
Message-ID: <1521598368.2893264.1310393928.5C49AB09@webmail.messagingengine.com>

So we aren't quite at beta yet, but we'll be shouting about pypi.org
*really soon*. We have nearly all the Warehouse improvements we need for
beta, and nearly all the infrastructure improvements we believe we'll
need for the switchover.

I'll tell you how you can help, then talk about the current state
of things.
 * The big blocker keeping us from beta: China & CAPTCHAs. Help
   advise us.[1]
 * Comment on a "needs discussion" issue[2].
 * Help us with large-scope JavaScript issues[3], like our frontend
   testing approach.
 * Please talk with Nicole about being a subject or interviewer for
   user tests[4].
 * Tell me if you're planning to join us at sprints at PyCon or
   EuroPython[5].
 * Check out our open good first Warehouse issues[6] (we usually have
   10+ open) and get started[7].

If you follow https://status.python.org/  you saw we did some load
testing last week and learned from it! We redirected some traffic, for a
few periods, for `pip install`, from the old server to Warehouse, and
learned from it. For instance, people running Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (long
term service release)[8] are usually using a pretty old version of pip,
and people on some versions of the Mac OS[9] have older versions of
Python and old versions of security-related libraries that don't support
the version of TLS that we want them to use. Ernest, Donald and Dustin
did a bunch of work addressing this, including Donald putting out pip
9.0.2[10].

(A thing to understand about Ernest's continuing work on PyPI and
distribution infrastructure is that it's in a lot of places. It's
cabotage[11] & a test cabotage app[12], configuration with salt[13],
conveyor[14], pip[15] & get-pip[16], and he filed a bug in
Kubernetes[17] which I personally find particularly impressive. And it's
in user-facing communication in IRC and GitHub comments and on our
statuspage and Twitter, plus a lot of internal discussion with
infrastructure colleagues. I have a harder time gathering links for
Ernest's work for these emails than for my other teammates; regrets.)

As usual, a summary of the past week's work is in our meeting notes[18].
We have new features like letting PyPI administrators add new trove
classifiers easily[19], infrastructure improvements like this complexity
reduction[20],  ton of polish and bug fixing around layout, description
content types (Markdown!), a FAQ restructuring[21], a more useful
collaboration page[22], etc. And we reviewed and merged a lot of
volunteers' pull requests!

Thanks to our prolific volunteers:
 *  pgadige making sure an error message reflects whether you're on PyPI
    or Test PyPI[23] *  waseem18 providing an error message for the password reset[24]
 *  cryvate fixing form requirements for password reset[25]
 *  waseem18 fixing disabled button CSS[26]
 *  yeraydiazdiaz fixing modal window behavior[27], then refixing[28]
 *  berkerpeksag adding a "public profile" link to the user dropdown[29] *  Mariatta sending notification email when a project
    collaborator's added[30] *  berkerpeksag hiding the "view project" button for no-release-yet
    projects in maintainers' project lists[31] *  alexwlchan renaming a CSS class for consistency[32]
 *  jMuzsik improving documentation of owners' and maintainers'
    privileges[33] *  yeraydiazdiaz adding JavaScript validation to show the user if "new
    password" and "confirm new password" don't match[34] *  alexwlchan documenting all the modifiers in our SASS directory[35]
 *  alanbato and yeraydiazdiaz adding a check to stop someone
    from uploading a file whose blake2 hash matches an already-
    uploaded file[36] *  cryvate improving sorting of package versions in our /simple/
    API[37] *  jMuzsik improving how PyPI links look on Twitter, adding an image to
    our Twitter cards[38]
 * 9999years updating the Python Packaging User Guide[39] and sample
   project[40] for Markdown/PEP 566
And thanks to our many bug reporters, especially those who helped us
learn from our load tests.
Also, check out discussion on API key support/macaroons[41],  supporting
GitHub-flavored Markdown as Description-Content-Type[42],  and project
rating/ranking/stars[43].
And finally, we are ever closer to accepting PEP 541 (and planning
followup tasks[44])  and are testing our PEP 566 compliance[45]. And I
may start a PEP for a Python package index upload API specification[46].
More next week, as usual.

*Thanks to Mozilla for their support[47] for the PyPI & Warehouse
work[48]!*

Subject: [Distutils] Removing wheel signing features from the wheel library
Message-ID: <1521659009.14379.6.camel@nextday.fi>

After spending quite some time thinking about this, I've decided to cut
out the wheel signature related features from the wheel codebase,
unless there is significant resistance among the readers of this
mailing list. For those not involved in the previous discussion, the
reasoning is that the codebase can be significantly simplified by
removing this rarely used feature whose practical value is questionable
at best, given the lack of infrastructure for public key distribution.

If, as a result, there is a public outcry (which I sincerely doubt), I
can always add it back to the next release.

> The more crucial deadline comes June 30, 2018. On that date all remaining python.org sites, including PyPI, will no longer support TSL 1.0 and 1.1. Older Python versions that do not implement TLSv1.2 will be prohibited from accessing PyPI.

I asked Ernest W. Durbin III whether I ought to re-announce this to
users in my PyPI announcements. He looked at our TLS trends/stats and
told me we have a very very low proportion of traffic that will be
affected when we shift over. Therefore, since it'll affect so few, I
won't shout about TLS versions in my PyPI communications. Marking that
here for the record.

Just as an FYI, as of this morning we?ve started doing brownouts of the deprecated TLS versions. For the first 10 minutes of each hour anyone attempting to access PyPI with TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.1 will get a 403 response with an informative error. 

As we get closer to the deadline I will be ramping up the amount of time the endpoint is down for the deprecated TLS versions. The ultimate goal being to have it be 100% unavailable prior to the final deadline (because we can give a good error messsge, once the dead line hits it will just be a crappy OpenSSL error).

Clarifying the scope here: is this about removing the hashes from the
RECORD file, or just about dropping the native support for injecting the
RECORD.jws and/or RECORD.p7s file? I ask as both of those features are
covered in the same section of PEP 427:
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/#signed-wheel-files

If it's just the latter, then I don't see any problem with that at all -
the generated wheels will still be completely compliant with PEP 427, it's
just that anyone that does want to sign RECORD will need to extract from
the archive, sign it, then add the signature file back in.

Changing the format of RECORD would be a problem though, since it's a
documented requirement that installers are expected to check those at
installation time.

Cheers,
Nick.

I am not changing the format of RECORD, I'm simply removing the
cryptographic signing and verifying functionality, just the way you
described. Hash checking will stay. As we agreed earlier, those
features could be deprecated or removed from the PEP entirely.

Cool, that's what I thought you meant, but I figured I should double check
since our discussion was a while ago now :)

What maintenance is required?

Here's a link to the previous discussion of this issue:

"Remove or deprecate wheel-signing features"
https://github.com/pypa/wheel/issues/196

What has changed? There is still no method for specifying a keyring;
whereas with GPG, all keys in the ring are trusted.

It's hard to say for sure, since that depends on what requirements come
up in the future. One thing this certainly affects is the test suite
which I plan to rewrite because I feel it is woefully inadequate.
Removing mostly unused features helps reduce the effort required for
that. Ditto for the general code refactoring which I'm also planning on
doing.

Even if no maintenance were required, it's still a feature that promises to
provide security but doesn't. This kind of feature has negative value.

I'd also suggest adding a small note to the PEP documenting that the
signing feature didn't work out, and maybe linking to Donald's package
signing blog post. I know updating PEPs isn't the most common thing, but
it's the main documentation of the wheel format and it'll save confusion
later.

The feature was a building block that was intended to be used in much the
same way that SHA package hashes are used, providing similar security to
the ssh-style TOFU model, but less security than other imaginable public
key systems. The idea was that it could provide more security in practice
because the signatures could exist and be present with the archive, unlike
gpg which provides loads of security in theory only. Unfortunately wheel
signatures were never built up. I don't think anyone was tricked into
believing the primitive provided security on its own.

The hashes serve as file integrity check but provide no assurance that they
are what the author intended to distribute because there is no
cryptographic signature.

File hashes help detect bit flips -- due to solar flares -- in storage or
transit, but do not mitigate against malicious package modification to
packages in storage or transit.

AFAIU, TUF (The Update Framework) has a mechanism for limiting which
signing keys are valid for which package? Are pre-shared keys then still
necessary, or do we then rely on a PKI where one compromised CA cert can
then forge any other cert?

Yes, you are right, the hashes need to be signed: otherwise you have
integrity, but no authenticity.

We wrote PEPs 458 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0458/> and 480
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0480/> to discuss how TUF might be
deployed on PyPI / Warehouse. The PEPs go into details about public key
distribution. The TLDR is that is that clients (i.e., pip) need to be
shipped with one self-signed root metadata file, and the rest of the PKI is
bootstrapped from there. PyPI would act as an authority that distributes,
revokes, and replaces public keys for packages.

More details on security vs usability also available in our Diplomat
<https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi16/technical-sessions/presentation/kuppusamy>
paper.

If the community is interested, we'd love to discuss how we could help make
this happen.

Thanks,
Trishank

You don't need a traditional CA for use with TUF or need to worry about a
single PKI.  TUF is built to be resilient to the compromise of single
servers / keys.

Typically you would ship the metadata about what keys to trust (TUF's "root
metadata") with the software installation tool.  This single set of
pre-shared metadata means you can securely obtain the rest of the
software.  (I'm happy to go into more detail, but wanted to avoid this
becoming a barrage of TUF details unless everyone is interested.)

If you don't want to ship the metadata with the tool, you can also have it
work in a trust-on-first-use model.  This is what Docker does in their
deployment of TUF.

I've been wondering about something ? zip files already contain CRC
based checksums for each the stored file. What benefit is there in
storing a RECORD file which basically duplicates this functionality?

I need to spend time reviewing these PEPs. Backseat driving here; sorry:

Are there pypa/warehouse github issues for implementing the TUF trust root
support in warehouse; and client support in pip (or a module that pip and
other tools can use)?

Warehouse is already a SPOF.
That's a hefty responsibility that contributions should support.

Would [offline] package mirrors and the CDN still work for/with TUF keys?


ld-signatures has some normative language that could be useful.

ld-signatures uses URIs for signature suites (a canonicalization algorithm,
a message digest algorithm, and a signature algorithm) and JSONLD. That
should be pretty future proof in regards to the NIST post-quantum
algorithms call that's under review at this time.

Blockcerts builds upon ld-signatures.

There's a compact form of JSONLD.
JSON[LD] can also be serialized as BSON (and RDFHDT).

AFAIU, there's no good way to do post-install hash verification like
`debsums` and `rpm -V` with zip CRCs (though it's probably possible if
there's a structured log of installed packages).

In terms of providing a foundation for security checks, I think CRC
checksums are insufficient - they are meant to detect random data
corruption, not a deliberate effort to make a malicious file.
You could simply use a cryptographic hash of the entire wheel zip file.
I guess the advantage of storing file hashes in RECORD is that they can
be checked against the installed code, not just the wheel package.

Warehouse doesn't need to be a SPOF.  A compromise of the Warehouse server
(and all keys on it) need not allow an attacker to compromise many users.
The details are in the Diplomat
<https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi16/technical-sessions/presentation/kuppusamy>
 paper, but the gist is that you can have some rarely used, offline keys
that are stored by folks like Donald, etc. and a quorum of those trusted
users would need to be malicious to cause substantial harm to users.

However, you can have whatever trust / key distribution / storage model
makes sense.  TUF doesn't force you to use some pre-ordained model.  It has
flexibility to support a variety of workflows, including many with good
security properties.

Would [offline] package mirrors and the CDN still work for/with TUF keys?
>

Yes, this works just fine.  CDNs / mirrors do not change in any way.

If someone wanted to make a malicious file, what's preventing them from
modifying the RECORD to match the modified file when there is no
cryptographic signing involved?

Right: you need a way to verify RECORD on top of that. Like the signatures, or way to distribute hashes of RECORD files separately. The hashes in RECORD are a foundation for building security systems, not a security system in themselves.

Subject: [Distutils] quickly installing packages in "editable" mode
Message-ID: <CAOTb1wcR2ZA61WRc6x1C-7U-7RiThmYcsfKbcx1KLCz8uywSSg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm interested in finding ways to speed up a development workflow that
involves installing several local packages in "editable" mode in a
Docker image.

For example, if I use `pip install -e project1 -e project2 ...` in a
certain case, it takes on the order of 3-4 seconds. But if I create
the .egg-link files, .egg-info directories, etc. "by hand," it only
takes on the order of 0.07 seconds.

I'm okay with using a hacky solution because these are simple, pure
Python projects and it's in a development environment, but if I can
rely on existing third-party libraries (via Python, not subprocess),
that would be ideal.

Do people know of libraries that can help with this sort of thing? As
another example, it seems like one of the steps is to update
"site-packages/easy-install.pth", but setuptools doesn't seem to
expose this as a stand-alone function. I also briefly glanced at
things like distlib, the "site" module, and pkg_resources, but I
didn't seem to see an API for updating a .pth file. Or maybe I can
bypass having to create / update a ".pth" by using symlinks.

Thanks,
--Chris

Subject: [Distutils] Warehouse is in beta
Message-ID: <21c865b3-334e-2e40-1a31-b765e2d84655@changeset.nyc>

As of today, the new Python Package Index at pypi.org, powered by
Warehouse, is in beta. What does that mean?

>From https://pypi.org/help/#beta :

The site is robust, but not *fully* tested and 'production ready'. This
means:

* The UI may return unusual or erroneous results
* Performance may not yet be optimised
* Some features that you used in the old interface (pypi.python.org) may
be missing
* We need your feedback to get the site production ready

While we are in beta, the pypi.org infrastructure cannot yet support all
of the API traffic generated by our users running pip install, so don't
explicitly point to it in automated production setups. But we want you
to try it and test it, and we're occasionally redirecting portions of
that traffic in load tests we announce on our status page.

Uploads, search, and release management are working well, and project
maintainers and owners should use this version of PyPI over the legacy
site, which no longer supports uploading releases.

More at
https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2018/03/warehouse-all-new-pypi-is-now-in-beta.html
. Congrats and thanks to the team, and onwards to the next milestone
(see https://wiki.python.org/psf/WarehouseRoadmap ), the launch and
redirect!

But as the following situation shows, I cannot succeed installing openpyxl.

>>> pip install openpyxl
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    pip install openpyxl
              ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

How can I succeed installing openpyxl ?

For general help to get started with Python I would recommend the
python-tutor mailing list; this one is for discussing the development of
how to package things in Python.

But in your specific case you typed the command in Python's REPL and not at
the terminal. For further help please ask on python-tutor.

Brett,

Thank you for responding me.
Could you tell me the e-mail address of the python-tutor ?
And if you have something even a little to be a hint to resolve this syntax error, it is appreciated to teach me.

Best Regards,

Hi,

Brett is just saying that you should first open a "cmd" shell, and, at
the cmd prompt, type:

pip install openpyxl

Your problem (which is relatively common) is that you were typing the
command at the Python prompt, instead of the cmd prompt.

Best,

Matthew

Mathew,

Thank you for your quick response.

Does ?cmd? shell mean MS-Windows command prompt ?

I executed in Windows command prompt and the result is shown below:

C:\Users\N.Morihira>pip install openpyxl
Pip is not recognized as executable command at Windows command prompt and so is Python command line.

If you're on Windows the command would be `py -m pip install openpyxl`
(since it sounds like you didn't check the box at install time to add
python to your PATH), although I would suggest doing `py -m pip install
--user openpyxl` instead (a virtual environment would be better, but
explaining that is off-topic for this mailing list).

Message-ID: <1522282727.855781.1319670768.3DF218AD@webmail.messagingengine.com>

(A short report this week that doesn't include as much detail about
merged PRs, infrastructure work, and so on, because I've been doing
stuff like writing to python-list/comp.lang.python to ask for
testing[1],  but next week's will have more.)
The new PyPI went to beta this week![2]

Now that PEP 541 is accepted, we are deciding on logistical stuff to
implement it and help deal with name transfer requests[3].
Cool things from the notes from the weekly Warehouse core developers'
meeting[4] include: if your PyPI project has docs already uploaded to
pythonhosted.org, you can now delete those docs[5]. (Further work on
docs transition is forthcoming.) And this week and next week some of our
team are busy with other projects, so code review and issue resolution
will be a little slower.
We have livechats coming up in Twitter & IRC[6] (next one is Friday the
30th), and tomorrow I hope to speak on the OpenNews community call[7] at
noon Eastern Time.
You can help this week by spreading the word[8] about the new PyPI beta
and testing it, by opining in our "needs discussion" issues[9], and by
just being your wonderful selves. Thank you for your help and kind words
through this whole process. It means a lot.
More soon!

Subject: [Distutils] PEP 571: Any further manylinux2010 concerns or
 questions?
Message-ID: <CADiSq7d00vsno60jTY1XwKDykj1L0UqzFZvDej1BS4V_4GxXvQ@mail.gmail.com>

PEP link: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0571/

Thomas Kluyver has amended Mark Williams's PEP 571 to address the
concerns & questions raised in the previous thread:

* manylinux2 -> manylinux2010:
https://github.com/python/peps/commit/70cbfda06534aedd6372f489090fdc8e1062de6e#diff-ed6b6d5f928c15489fc02dca72f4b519
* using glibc 2.12 as a compatibility marker:
https://github.com/python/peps/commit/d43b984e021eddc11bdbc36863c5c285b473f8a7#diff-ed6b6d5f928c15489fc02dca72f4b519

(We also dropped a potentially misleading aside that could be taken as
implying inaccurate limitations on Anaconda platform compatibility)

As I expect quite a few folks will be busy for the Easter weekend, I'm
planning to accept the PEP a week from next Monday (i.e on April 9th)
if no new concerns or objections are raised between now and then :)

Cheers,
Nick.

Hi Nick,

Long time no see --- hope everything is well on your side :)

First of all, thanks Mark, Thomas, and everyone else for your hard work on
manylinux2010 --- I'm excited about this release, as I'm sure many others
are!

This may be the wrong thread to discuss this, and I haven't looked too
deeply into it, but are there plans to support container-specific Linux
distros like Alpine that use musl instead of glibc? I'm guessing the answer
is "no," but I'm curious to hear what others think on the subject.

Happy Easter!

Thanks,
Trishank

Subject: [Distutils] Beta release of pip version 10
Message-ID: <CACac1F9Hgd09sxz+i3mmTi43B7dEsc43UE4TOu3QGhthgSXx1A@mail.gmail.com>

On behalf of the PyPA, I am pleased to announce that a beta release
10.0.0b1 of pip has just been released for testing by the community.
We're planning on a final release in 2 weeks' time, over the weekend
of 14/15 April.

To install pip 10.0.0.b1, you can run

    python -m pip install --upgrade --pre pip

(obviously, you should not do this in a production environment!)

We would be grateful for all testing that users could do, to ensure
that when pip 10 is released it's as solid as we can make it.

Highlights of the new release:

* Python 2.6 is no longer supported - if you need pip on Python 2.6,
you should stay on pip 9, which is the last version to support Python
2.6.
* Support for PEP 518, which allows projects to specify what packages
they require in order to build from source. (PEP 518 support is
currently limited, with full support coming in future versions - see
the documentation for details).
* Significant improvements in Unicode handling for non-ASCII locales on Windows.
* A new "pip config" command.
* The default upgrade strategy has become "only-if-needed"
* Many bug fixes and minor improvements.

In addition, the previously announced reorganisation of pip's
internals has now taken place. Unless you are the author of code that
imports the pip module (or a user of such code), this change will not
affect you. If you are, please report the issue to the author of the
affected code (refer them to
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2017-October/031642.html
for the details of the announcement).

Please note that there is a minor issue with the NEWS file for this
release - the new features in 10.0.0b1 are reported as being for
"9.0.3 (2018-03-31)".

If you discover any bugs while testing the new release, please report
them at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues.

Thanks to everyone who put so much effort into the new release. Many
of the contributions came from community members, whether in the form
of code, participation in design discussions, or bug reports. The pip
development team is extremely grateful to everyone in the community
for their contributions.

Thanks,
Paul

It is, so I've forked the conversation ?

Are there other container-specific distros other than Alpine that people
use widely?

The discussion of distro-specific wheels has been brought up. I believe
they are technically supported if you have your own index server, but PyPI
doesn't, I believe, to keep an explosion of wheels people can't widely use
down.

Currently, if you want to cover all formats PyPI supports you need to
produce 5 wheels. Adding a musl-based wheel format would bump that to 7 (as
I assume musl supports 23 and 64-bit OSs).

For me, the questions of whether to support musl-based wheels on PyPI is
will there be enough users to justify the cost to all project maintainers
to produce 2 more wheels per release and what would the
manylinux-equivalent spec look like (since it would have to be generic and
not specific to Alpine)?

I don?t think PyPI has any reason not to add more possible wheel variants, ultimately it comes down to the authors to decide which variants it makes sense to support. A MUSL version of manylinux might be very reasonable, or it might be crazy hard to nail down. I also don?t think there?s any reason we can?t have a PEP that figured out a standard format for distro specific wheels, and just let people produce alpine linux specific wheels (authors could just not produce say, ubuntu specific wheels and say they?re already covered by manyinux, or they could produce ubuntu specific if they want to rely on apt-get installed C libraries).

The main reason PyPI doesn't currently support distro specific wheels is
because there isn't a compatibility tagging spec for them that's reasonable
to use on a public index server - they currently end up being tagged as
generic "linux" wheels. You can live with that on a private index server
like the one that https://galaxyproject.org/ runs, but it would be
incredibly confusing on PyPI.

As far as I know,
https://mail.python.org/pipermail/distutils-sig/2015-July/026617.html is
still the most complete write-up we have of a potential way to fix that,
which is to:

1. extend the default Linux platform tag to include the ID and VERSION_ID
fields from /etc/os-release (credit to Galaxy Project's Nate Coraor for
that core concept)
2. define a config file under /etc/python/ that distros can use to change
both the build tag (e.g. allowing CentOS users to emit RHEL compatible
wheels, or Ubuntu users to emit Debian compatible ones), and a list of
binary compatible distro tags (e.g. allowing CentOS to consume RHEL tagged
wheels, Ubuntu to consume Debian tagged wheels, and other musl based
distros to consume Alpine tagged wheels)
3. define an equivalent per-virtualenv file to override the settings from
(2)
4. update pip/setuptools/twine/warehouse/etc to account for the new
compatibility tag variant

One useful aspect here is that older clients will just ignored the new tags
as "not a match", which means there shouldn't be any significant backwards
compatibility hurdles.

Honestly, I think the main benefit of heading down this road will be to
allow folks to cache their custom wheel builds more effectively, so I'm not
especially worried about making it generic (beyond the platform level
config file suggested above).

That said, if there were to be a significant growth in non-manylinux Linux
wheels on PyPI, I'd expect them to be for the official Docker Inc base
Python images, which are Alpine based, and hence can't use the glibc-based
manylinux binaries.

Nick.
